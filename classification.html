									<p>
									</p>
								</header>
								
								<p> The main objective of this project was to explore the automation of land cover classification based on multiple spectral bands from satellite imagery through the construction of a function. The function created is capable of performing unsupervised and supervised classifications.
									Allowing validation by comparison with observations, if possible, was the secondary objective of this function. This objective is completed by the calculation of some usual performance indices which are a confusion matrix and the associated kappa index.
									<b>It should be noted that this personal project focused more on exploring automation in the context of remote sensing than on classification results per se.</b> Although it already shows great results, the first case study could easily have been improved with a larger training database.
										The second case study deepens the automation process by leveraging an open land cover database. The results obviously depend heavily on the quality, quantity and diversity of the observations.
									<b>The objective here is to demonstrate that a certain level of automation has been achieved and that the results could be easily improved only by having access to one or more additional databases and by choosing more carefully satellite images.
									</b></p>
								
								<h2>Workflow</h2>
								<p> <code>classification()</code> function requires at least two mandatory inputs to run: a rasterStack composed of different relevant spectral bands and a spatial object (from sp or sf packages) delimiting the study region. The function can be completed with optional inputs which are a shapefile with training area, i.e. polygons assigned to the class actually observed (necessary for the supervised classification) and a validation text file. 
									In case these two elements are not specified, the function searches in the geo-wiki ground based observations database (<a href="https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.869682">https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.869682</a>, Fritz et al, 2016 ) to check if there is enough data for the study region to replace the missing arguments.
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/inputs.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Concerning the processing, the first step is the smoothing of the satellite images via the <code>focal()</code> function. This first step benefits from the paralellization. Then the spatial object delimiting the region is reprojected to match the projection of the images. These are cropped and masked by the region object.</p>
								<p>The classification is then carried out. In the case of the unsupervised algorithm (via the <code>kmeans()</code> function) tries to gather similar cells, ie close to each other in the multiple space where each dimension is a spectral band. For this, the raster must be transformed into a vector where each element corresponds to a cell of the raster. Finally, a console call to the user is made to assign the different groups to their land cover class. Note that, for an unsupervised classification, it is generally recommended to request more land cover classes than necessary and to regroup some of them after classification (methodological advice, not related to this specific project and function). The desired number of classes is chosen with the <code>k</code> argument.</p>
								<p>Regarding supervised classification, if the training file is given, it is transformed into a spatial object by <code>coordinates()</code>. The object is then reprojected so that its projection matches that of the images. In case the file is missing, the geo wiki database is downloaded from the URL, unzipped and all unnecessary information is removed so that the file is finally a clean table. Then, it undergoes the same steps as a training file that would have been specified but also an <code>intersection()</code> function so that only the observations of the region studied remain. Only 75% of the observations will be used to perform the classification, the remaining 25% will be used for validation. The supervised algorithm (via the <code>rpart()</code> function) attempts to find a specific spectral signature for each class. The classes are separated by a "classification tree" from which is calculated the probability that each cell belongs to each class (via the <code>predict()</code> function). Finally, the cell is assigned to the class to which it has the highest probability of belonging.</p>
								<p>In case a validation file is provided or there is enough data in the geo wiki database for the given region, the classification values ​​are extracted from the observation point locations and observations and predictions are combined in the same dataframe. From this data frame is created a confusion matrix which is a table comparing the predicted classes with the actual classes. Observations in the diagonal of the matrix are well classified. From this matrix, the producer, the user, the total accuracy and the kappa index are calculated. This last index measures the accuracy of the classification considering the possibility of agreement resulting from luck. See the comments in the code for detailed step-by-step explanations.</p>
								<p>The final outputs are therefore the classified raster, the confusion matrix and the kappa index.</p>

								<p>Unsurprisingly, the results are already much better. Fields occupy most of the territory. Grasslands and forests are rarer. Large urban areas can be easily distinguished and major roads such as highways are even noticeable.
									The confusion matrix and the kappa index also show good results. However, caution should be exercised due to the low number of observations.

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/unsup_london.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Note that there are only two classes whereas the call to the function required four classes. In fact, given the nature of the unsupervised classification and the “ultra-urban” character of central London, the algorithm distinguished between different types of urban areas before distinguishing urban areas from other classes (this is related to the advice to request more classes than necessary and gather them after the classification). Therefore, three different types of urban areas were manually grouped into one class.
									Asking for 8 classes as in the next map would give better end results but would require more post work to interpret the different classes.
								</p>

								<p>Finally, a supervised classification of the same region, using the geo wiki database as training and validation files, will be carried out.</p>

								<p>The result obviously strongly depends on the database used to train the model. However, among the four hundred observations made in the region, <b>only one concerned the “water” class</b>. This explains why this class is so poorly represented, e.g. the River Thames is clearly visible and has been assigned to cultivated areas.
									Better results could not be expected with so few observations!
									<b>As a reminder, the objective here was to demonstrate that a certain level of automation has been achieved and that the results could be easily improved only by having access to one or more additional databases and by choosing more carefully satellite images.</b>
