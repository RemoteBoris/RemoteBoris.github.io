								<header class="major"><h1>Thematic mapping of France</h1>
									<p>This project aimed to study the spatial patterns of different types of variables in metropolitan France, to
										the department level. Economic, demographic and geographic data are analyzed. Correlations
										between these variables were also sought, on the basis of preliminary hypotheses. 
										This is for the official story... actually it was a way to explore the potential of <strong>sf</strong> R library to perform common GIS processes (join, merge, aggregate, zonal statistics,...) and <strong>tmap</strong> package for thematic mapping!</p>
								</header>
								<h2>Methodology</h2>
									<h3>Data</h3>
								
										<p>Administrative shapefile at the level of departments (polygons vector data)
											and the French road network (polylines vector data) have been downloaded on the DIVA-GIS
											(n.d.) website [1]. The road network includes the main roads that are highways, national and departmental roads. In addition, various variables were downloaded on the <i>Institut national de la
											statistique et des études économiques</i> (INSEE ; n.d.) website [2]:
											<div class="row">
												<ul>
													<li>At the level of municipalities, the population by sex and age group (10 groups) in 2018.</li>
													<li>At the level of municipalities, the number of unemployed persons in the active population
														(15-64 years old) in 2018.
														</li>
													<li>At the level of departments, the average net hourly wage [€/hour] in 2017 (in this project,
														it is assumed that the values are the same in 2018).</li>
												</ul>									
										</div>
									<h3>GIS procedure and Cartography</h3>
										<p>Different interesting variables were calculated from previously downloaded data. Firstly, the
											total population per municipality was calculated as the sum of population in all sex and age group
											combinations. Similarly, the total active population was calculated as the sum of population in the
											15-64 age group. The unemployment variable was retained as provided by the INSEE. Since these
											variables were at the municipality level, they have been joined by their unique geographic
											code (unlike the name of municipalities which is not always unique). Then, they were aggregated
											into departments. Salary data was also joined to the database at the department level, as well as
											the associated and unique department names that allowed the join with the department shapefile.
											The surface of department was also joined. It was calculated on a temporary reprojection of
											the shapefile into a equal-area projection (conserving the area, unlike the projection used for
											mapping).
											Once all the absolute variables at the department level, relative variables were calculated. The population density [inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>], the active population proportion [%] and
											the unemployment proportion [%] were calculated.</p>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Distance.png" alt="" /></span>After verifying that the administrative and roads shapefiles used the same coordinate system, an
											empty raster was created from the administrative shapefile and the distance from each cell center
											to the nearest road was calculated. To reduce the calculation time, the resolution was
											deliberately chosen coarse. Then, a zonal statistical method was applied to extract
											the mean value of the nearest road for each department</p>
										<div class="image main"><img src="images/Distance_zoom.png" alt="" /></div>
										<p><b>Therefore, the final variables used for mapping and correlation testing are : population density [inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>], active population proportion [%], unemployment proportion [%], mean
										distance to nearest road [km] and mean net hourly wage [€/hour].</b></p>
										<p>To remain consistent in the representation of spatial patterns, choices regarding the classification
										were made and applied to all variables. Some data being highly non-normally distributed,
										the quantile classification for mapping was preferred. Moreover, all maps used a
										5-class classification as a compromise between detail and readability.</p>
									<h3>Statistics</h3>
										<p>The correlations between the salary and the other variables were also studied, on the
											basis of preliminary assumptions. Scatterplots of the hourly salary (Y) as a function of the
											other variables (X) were displayed. Linear regression model lines and their respective r<sup>2</sup>, when the
											model was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05), were also calculated. Since the statistical
											test requires a normal distribution, a distribution verification was performed beforehand.
											The population density being highly non-normally distributed, its logarithm was used instead.
											According to the preliminary assumptions, the wage should increase with the population density
											which is probably a good proxy of cities and job opportunities. The wage might increase with the
											proportion of active population which could be higher in the cities. Finally, wages are expected
											to increase with the access to transport and therefore decrease with the mean distance to the nearest main
											road. So far, these are only simple assumptions (especially between wage and active population
											proportion; knowing the complex interactions of numerous variables in the real world) and they
											might not be verified. That's the whole point of statistical testing!</p>

								<h2>Results and discussion</h2>
									<h3> Spatial patterns</h3>
									
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/density.png" alt="" /></span>The population is not evenly distributed in France. The vast majority of departments have a
									population density of less than 200 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>. The few remaining departments
									present huge densities (>5000 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>), around the capital city. Departments in and
									around Paris, as well as in the far North, in Alsace, in Bretagne or along the Mediterranean sea
									are the most densely populated (>200 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>). The center of France and
									Corsica present really low density values (< 50 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>).
									</p>
								<br>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/prop_active.png" alt="" /></span>The proportion of the active population varies between 53 and 67 %. The highest values are found in and around Paris, in Alsace and the North region or in more isolated departments such as in Gironde, Haute-Garonne or Ille-et-Vilaine (more than 59%). The center of the country has a lower
									proportion of active people (around 55%).</p>
								<br><br><br><br><br>
								<p>Regarding the unemployment, the far South, the North and North-East regions are more affected (up to 8.5% of unemployement). The North-West and the Center-East regions present lower values of unemployment.
									A strong contrast is also visible in departments around Paris.
									Unsurprisingly in France the road network is well developed. The distance is lower in the North-West region and higher in the region
									close to Spain and in the Eastern part of the country even if the highest values
									found in the country are quite low. The maximum departmental mean distance to a main road (departmental
									or wider road) is less than 6 kilometers. Unsurprisingly, the lowest values are found close to the
									capital city, where the road network is highly densified.</p>

										</div>
									</div>
								
								<p>Finally, the mean net hourly wage varies between 11 and 23€/hour and seems to be higher in departments containing and around the
									main cities of the country which are Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Nice, Nantes, Montpellier,
									Strasbourg and Bordeaux (>14 €/hour). The lowest values are mainly found in the Center of
									the country. It is already clear that certain spatial patterns of this last map seem to be found in the previous one as well. That's why the next section will be useful and will more reliably confirm whether these links exist or not!
									</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/hourly_wage.png" alt="" /></div>

								<p>Note that caution should be exercised when analysing spatial patterns because the choice made
									to map the data can alter these patterns. Different elements are responsible such as the way unit
									areas were created and the scale at which they are represented (Modifiable areal unit problem -
									MAUP), the chosen classification method (equal classes, quantile, jenks, logarithm, etc.), the
									number of classes, the projection, etc.</p>	
								
								<h3>Correlations</h3>
								<p>A significant correlation was found between the hourly wage and the logarithm of population density. As expected, the wage increases with population density. Hourly wage variation
									is explained at 67% by the logarithm of population density. However, the relation seems to
									be weaker for high values of the density logarithm (and therefore for extremely high values
									of density). A second significant correlation was found, between the hourly wage and the active
									population proportion. As expected, the wage increases with the active population
									proportion. 53% of the hourly wage variation is explained by this variable. The correlation seems
									to be weaker for high active population proportions.</p>

									<div class="column">
										<img src="images/log-density.PNG" alt="" style="width:100%">
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<img src="images/active_scatterplot.PNG" alt="" style="width:100%">
									</div>
								</div>	

								<p>The correlations between the hourly wage and the unemployment proportion and the mean
									distance to the nearest road were not significant and therefore are not shown. However, the
									absence of relation can also be interpreted. Departments where the salary is higher are not less (or more) sensitive to the unemployment. The absence
									of relation between the wage and the access to the road network might be related to the high
									development of the country. France is quite rich in general, and the road network is well developed
									everywhere (the range between the minimum and maximum values is small). As stated earlier,
									the maximum mean distance to a main road is less than 6 kilometers. There is no real physical
									limitation to access a job and a higher salary. The correlation could however exist in other, poorer
									countries, where the network is less developed (assumption to be verified).</p>
